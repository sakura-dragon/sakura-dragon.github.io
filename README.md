My site for being awesome

This site uses github pages - Please visit sakura-dragon.github.io for the actual site.

And don't expect too much right now as I've only just made the sites :)

---
A few notes for my sanity so that I don't have to re-remember how to build the site locally.

First make sure [jekyll is installed](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
```bash
# Make sure requirements are installed
bundle update

# local server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
